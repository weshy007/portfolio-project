                <li><strong>The Dormans Project</strong></li>
                The project was about creating simple website for a coffee lounge based in Nanyuki. 
                The project was incomplete by the end of the the time phrame. The languages used were HTML and CSS </br>

                <li><strong>Sponsorship Project</strong></li>
                This was a project to bring together sponsors in one platfod to help students who need scolars. It was built on HTML and CSS

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>This is My Story</strong> </br>
            I come from a small town called Nanyuki in county 031 Laikipia County. I did my primary school studies there and finished in the year 2010.
            I was privileged to join secondary school in the footsteps of aberdare mountains called Ngobit Boys' where I finished in the year 2014.
            I didn't join and tertiary institution due to financial constraints but that wasn't the end of my story. I worked on casual jobs and saved till I bought a laptop and started to research more on programming.
            In the year 2017 someone mentioned Moringa School but I didnt put much attention to it, but it was somewhere in my mind.
            Due to my interest in programming, I used to check on Moringa once in while to just motivate myself. Mid year 2020 they had this offer on Prep of 80% discount and I thought that was my moment. 
            I did apply but late so the discount passed me and I ended up being given a chance to interview for Access programme. On the October 19th I was given the good news to join Moringa School on a full-scholarship.
