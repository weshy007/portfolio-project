        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>This is My Story</strong> </br>
            I come from a small town called Nanyuki in county 031 Laikipia County. I did my primary school studies there and finished in the year 2010.
            I was privileged to join secondary school in the footsteps of aberdare mountains called Ngobit Boys' where I finished in the year 2014.
            I didn't join and tertiary institution due to financial constraints but that wasn't the end of my story. 
            I worked on casual jobs and saved till I bought a laptop and started to research more on programming.
            In the year 2017 someone mentioned Moringa School but I didnt put much attention to it, but it was somewhere in my mind.
            Due to my interest in programming, I used to check on Moringa once in while to just motivate myself.
            Mid-year 2020 they had this offer on Prep of 80% discount and I thought that was my moment. 
            I did apply but late so the discount passed me and I ended up being given a chance to interview for Access programme. 
            On the October 19th I was given the good news to join Moringa School on a full-scholarship.</br>Apply to <a href="https://moringaschool.com/">Moringa School</a></p>
